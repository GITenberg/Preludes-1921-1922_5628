  Though black the night, I know upon the sky,<br />
  A little paler now, if clouds were none,<br />
  The stars would be. Husht now the thickets lie,<br />
  And now the birds are moving one by one,&mdash;<br />
  A note&mdash;and now from bush to bush it goes&mdash;<br />
  A prelude&mdash;now victorious light along<br />
  The west will come till every bramble glows<br />
  With wash of sunlit dew shaken in song.<br />
  Shaken in song;  O heart, be ready now,<br />
  Cold in your night, be ready now to sing.<br />
  Dawn as it wakes the sleeping bird on bough<br />
  Shall summon you to instant reckoning,&mdash;<br />
  She is your dawn, O heart,&mdash;sing, till the night<br />
  Of death shall come, the gospel of her light.<br />

  DAVID AND JONATHAN<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  And Jonathan too had honour in his heart,<br />
  Jonathan who with an armour-bearer went<br />
  Alone by Michmash to the Philistines,<br />
  And met a spray of swords because of courage<br />
  That made him single greater than a host.<br />
  Jonathan too had known his battles, dared<br />
  At any hour the coming of death, because<br />
  In twilight silence he had walked with God,<br />
  Read Him in blossoms and the mountain brooks,<br />
  And learnt that death, well known, can alter nothing.<br />
  He was a brown man, burnt with love of summer,<br />
  His young beard curled, and russet as the eyes<br />
  That looked on life, and feared it, yet were master,<br />
  Because they knew the tyranny they feared,<br />
  Measured it, learnt it, gazed it into nothing.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  ....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And now he watched the boy, the son of Jesse,<br />
  David with hair like maples in October,<br />
  And skin that women loving coveted,<br />
  David with eyes that often by the sheepfolds<br />
  Had looked through leaves up to the folds of heaven,<br />
  And seeing them crammed with golden fleece of stars,<br />
  Had known how the blood can run because of beauty.<br />
  Jonathan watched him take the armour off<br />
  Given by Saul, and choose the bright smooth pebbles,<br />
  And walk out from the Israelitish throng<br />
  Into the field against the Philistine giant.<br />
  Watching, he snatched his sword and cried to Saul,<br />
  "Bid him come back. This murder must not be."<br />
  And as he spoke, he knew the words were treason,<br />
  His heart alone in all the world was sure<br />
  That David was the Lord's appointed arm,<br />
  To meet this bulk of dirt, this giant fear<br />
  Brandishing out of the loathly camps of evil.<br />
  And before Saul could answer, he put down<br />
  The sword, and said, "I love him. Let him go."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  ....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But the words, I love him, were not for his father Saul,<br />
  Hardly Jonathan knowing he spake them out.<br />
  But as he looked on David love was there,<br />
  Waking from that in David that he himself<br />
  A little was, and always greatly shaping<br />
  Himself towards, so that his name was spoken<br />
  Famously in Saul's kingdom. It was courage,<br />
  The clean heart, undivided in its doing,<br />
  The purpose that, being bodied in the brain,<br />
  Thenceforth knew every trickling argument<br />
  That fell from tongues of persuading circumstance,<br />
  As lures of evil ever threatening life,<br />
  That Jonathan loved above all enterprise.<br />
  He knew, or the rarer man within him knew,<br />
  That once your yea in holy meditation<br />
  Had shaped itself in the perfect syllable,<br />
  Thenceforth no nay from any other tongue<br />
  Or wise or passionate or masterful,<br />
  Could be listened to without the shame of sin<br />
  Corrupting all your constancy for ever.<br />
  He knew the curse of good betraying good,<br />
  Till both in bleak irresolution fall.<br />
  And all his years was Jonathan's anguish only<br />
  To keep this tillage of his wisdom clean.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Since boyhood he had known Philistia<br />
  For the black thing it was, a plague opposed<br />
  Always against the loveliness of Israel,<br />
  And when his father Saul was anointed king<br />
  By Samuel in Ramah, then Jonathan knew<br />
  How all the lessons of his youth had been<br />
  To fit him for the striking of the men<br />
  Who profaned beauty and let the soul be blind.<br />
  And he was diligent in bronze and arms,<br />
  And kept his body supple, and his eye<br />
  Keen, and the coming of his hooves was thunder,<br />
  Wherever battle fell. He bore a flame,<br />
  Zealous and pure, in the heavens of his mind,<br />
  To serve and to instruct. Aye, to instruct&mdash;<br />
  There was the biting blemish, as we shall see.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Philistia was foul, and Jonathan knew,<br />
  And the voice of God within him was plain and constant<br />
  To strike and strike unwearying to the end.<br />
  And then the poor, precise, infirmity<br />
  That loads good minds with ever seeming virtue,<br />
  Until they cast their treasure to the dust,<br />
  Crept on him, wound about the gleaming truth<br />
  That was his one foundation. Day by day<br />
  He was resolved, and then the grain of doubt<br />
  Would come to hurt the riding of his thought,<br />
  And break the level balance that it had.<br />
  Was then the Philistine mere black? That day<br />
  Jonathan's arm half paused upon the blow,<br />
  And evil went a little scatheless off.<br />
  Surely the worst even of adversaries<br />
  Had somewhere beams that pointed to salvation,<br />
  And hasty judgment might not be the will<br />
  Of an all-seeing Lord? Then would the vengeance<br />
  Falter, and stay, and Jonathan's battle failed.<br />
  And always then was bitterness and reproach<br />
  In the night watches when upon his couch<br />
  He looked on the stars studding his little window<br />
  Before sleep came. Then he would speak again<br />
  The word that single was his valiance,<br />
  His only truth, his warrant as a man,<br />
  And once again Philistia was doomed.<br />
  Then for a season clean the stroke and sure<br />
  That Jonathan drove, and black was known for black,<br />
  Till slowly as before would mount and mount<br />
  Scruple on scruple, as was not he himself<br />
  A little black sometimes, or plainly wicked?<br />
  And should the wicked man not be redeemed?<br />
  Merely destruction surely was no answer,<br />
  Since yet the wickedness must wander somewhere?<br />
  How should he say, I, Jonathan of Israel<br />
  Am good, and you the Philistine are cursed,<br />
  Since in that face was something that had been<br />
  Learnt from the buds and corn and frozen hills<br />
  That he himself had known for seals of God?<br />
  And would not his power on Israel increase,<br />
  Take on a loftier authority,<br />
  If to his famous arms he could add a tale<br />
  Of counsel working in the hearts of men,<br />
  Moving them to a finer charity,<br />
  A little pity for offence? And so<br />
  Instruction like a worm was at his roots,<br />
  And pride of virtue made Jonathan forget.<br />
  Then sometimes as he knew himself betrayed<br />
  He would cry upon his spirit in the night&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I, Jonathan, who know<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The processes of God<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Moving within me,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Turn aside to my idols of desire.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He has taught me the ways<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of Philistine cruelty. He<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Shows me the bad man toiling to the ruin<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of beauty and the free spirit on earth,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And has equipped me for the establishment<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Of His will in this battle, and I fail.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I am a leaf spinning about the wind,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Who have been shown the ways of stedfastness.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  O Israel, I have heard<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My dedication made<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  To your sweet service by the voice of Him,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  And I betray<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  That wisdom, that great simpleness of wisdom,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Inventing in my brain<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Fantastic argument<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  As though God's mind<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Had missed the brighter pools<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  That I alone could visit and gaze into.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  He tells me, and I hear<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Voices not His.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Knowing, I question. And I am ashamed.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So Jonathan saw walking at his side<br />
  Always a shadow that was his own denial.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And now was April mirrored in the plumes<br />
  Of ravens and the green of the young wheat,<br />
  And dusky ewes with white lambs in the sun<br />
  Lay in the valley plain between the hosts<br />
  Of Israel and Philistia. And on this day<br />
  Jonathan learnt utter reproach, and love.<br />
  There on the plain Goliath stood alone,<br />
  Poised in his mighty bulk, with black locks flowing,<br />
  A handsbreadth taller even than Saul the king<br />
  Who shouldered it above the men of Israel,<br />
  And beat his words of sure defiance out,<br />
  Ringing across the windless noon. And all<br />
  Israel heard, and fear was on them, knowing,<br />
  If thus the issue, how it should prevail.<br />
  And Jonathan in the tent of Saul his father,<br />
  Watched, and his blood was quick, and in his mind<br />
  He strove against the last of doubt. And then<br />
  The young man David stood before them, bidden<br />
  By Saul, who heard one say, "There is a boy<br />
  New come from tending sheep in Bethlehem,<br />
  And seeks the king." And David stood before them,<br />
  And asked no leave, but said, "There was a cause.<br />
  It bade me come, and I will fight with him."<br />
  And Saul denied, but David did not hear<br />
  Denial, saying, "the wild beasts of the field<br />
  I with my hand have slain at the fold's gate,<br />
  And this is mine to do." And David stood,<br />
  Greater than argument while Saul armed him there.<br />
  And Jonathan saw the purpose that he was not,<br />
  Glowing and bodied, and his love was born.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then David flung the armour off, and said,<br />
  "I am David, and I know not these strange arms.<br />
  I must go out as I have always been,<br />
  Not girt with new occasion. It is I,<br />
  David the shepherd that am David still,<br />
  And I know nothing of your spears and plate.<br />
  A sheepskin have I worn, and in my hand<br />
  A sling, and pebbles taken from the brook.<br />
  Now shall I go, content that God has watched me<br />
  So habited and armed through all my youth.<br />
  Should I pretend another David now,<br />
  I should meet this man with neither honour nor hope.<br />
  If I am sent against the Philistine<br />
  Out of God's anger, and I know it is so,<br />
  It is not one the chosen of Saul's hosts,<br />
  But I, David of Bethlehem must go,<br />
  The son of Jesse, and keeper of his flocks."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Almost the tears were seen in Jonathan's eyes,<br />
  Because of David's words, of which he knew<br />
  The poor ghosts hiding somewhere in his own heart.<br />
  And then he spoke his fear, and then the words,<br />
  Resting his sword, "I love him. Let him go."<br />
  And David stept out of the emerald light<br />
  That played up from the grass floor of the tent,<br />
  Into the full flood of the April noon,<br />
  And walked a little way, and those two stood<br />
  Parted a hundred paces, the man of terror,<br />
  Hewn massy and with shock of builded limbs,<br />
  And David moulded like a sea boy risen<br />
  From caves of music where the water spins<br />
  Wet sand into the shapes of flowing flowers;<br />
  David with limbs all bright with the sun's tones,<br />
  And ruddy locks curling with youth and light,<br />
  His body all alert on steady loins,<br />
  Clean spun of flesh that knew the winter snows,<br />
  And mellow pools of summer, and the dews<br />
  Dropping among the crocuses of dawn.<br />
  His sandle-straps bound ankles as a girl's,<br />
  And fluttering to his knees the sheepskin hung,<br />
  Cloaking one shoulder, while the other gleamed.<br />
  And there he paused, the sling in his right hand,<br />
  His left hand fingering the pouch of pebbles,<br />
  While Israel fearing murmured, and the hosts<br />
  Of Philistine derision rocked the noon.<br />
  Then did Goliath cry, "Am I a dog,<br />
  For a boy's whipping? Have you not a man,<br />
  That you would send a cleaner up of crumbs<br />
  From the queen's table? Come then, and be broken,<br />
  For birds to find you and the dogs at night."<br />
  And Jonathan heard Philistia shout again,<br />
  And David, like a flame unwinded, stood<br />
  Quivering at the cry, and laid a stone<br />
  In the sling's fold, and cast his staff, and ran,<br />
  Fleet as the king bird gliding under leaves,<br />
  Towards Goliath. And a giant spear<br />
  Swung from the Philistine hand, and forty paces<br />
  Sang in the air and brushed the flying sheepskin,<br />
  And sudden David's feet were planted firm,<br />
  Locked on the earth, and circling in the sun<br />
  The tight thong flashed and loosened, and the stone<br />
  Smote the Philistine wrath above the eyes,<br />
  And the day was clouded from him, and he fell.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then Israel spared not. And, when night was come,<br />
  Jonathan sent for David to his tent,<br />
  And those two sat while the yellow torches burned,<br />
  And Jonathan spoke and said, "David, my brother,<br />
  To-day you have made a story that shall be<br />
  For ever fruitful in the heart of man.<br />
  This day is David's. But of this day I too<br />
  Share, not in the honour, but in the harvesting,<br />
  Or the harvesting I think is wholly mine.<br />
  Shall I speak on?" And David said, "Speak on."<br />
  Then Jonathan&mdash;"This morning there was a man,<br />
  And it was Jonathan, who many years<br />
  Had gone snared in a purpose not his own,<br />
  That is, not truly mine. Always I knew,<br />
  Walking by that self I said was honest,<br />
  Another self, the true self, in a shadow,<br />
  Or at an angle that my eyes refused.<br />
  I was a proud man, David, very virtuous,<br />
  Or, in fairness to myself, desiring virtue,<br />
  Truly desiring it, I may say that.<br />
  And yet even in that desire there moved<br />
  A lie, for I knew the virtue of my desire<br />
  Was something tainted. No&mdash;I knew it not,<br />
  But that other self walking beside me knew it,<br />
  And whispered, I knew, a thing that I would not hear.<br />
  Always it whispered, as I stood alone,<br />
  I said, in subtle thought among all Israel.<br />
  God had spoken to me, David, that the Philistine<br />
  Was evil, evil, that was all God said,<br />
  And bade me strike as a man by God assured.<br />
  But the man to whom God spoke I put aside,<br />
  The still self walking, whispering, in the shadow.<br />
  And I, the Jonathan of daily light,<br />
  Tempered the word of God, I tempered it&mdash;<br />
  I who should be God's outcast doing so.<br />
  I counted evil twenty different ways,<br />
  And none of them plain evil. I diced with God,<br />
  And the dice fell as often to my hand,<br />
  It seemed, as His, but falling so the whisper<br />
  Was ever shadowed at my ear, unheard.<br />
  And ever as this new intelligence,<br />
  This pride of thought, crept over me and filled<br />
  My dawn and noon and sleep, a hunger grew,<br />
  A dreadful hunger for that self denied,<br />
  And every word I spoke for righteousness<br />
  Turned bitter on my lips, because I knew<br />
  That every word was righteousness undone.<br />
  Such was the man this morning when you came,<br />
  Who from the king's tent watched you, David. Then<br />
  Change and completion and I know not what<br />
  Of heavenly fulfilment fell upon me.<br />
  Not from myself, nor of my own devising,<br />
  But marvellously spoken in a space<br />
  Of golden light that glowed about the form<br />
  Of a boy standing in my father's tent.<br />
  Quite suddenly the thing I lacked was there,<br />
  The shadow whispering at my side had gone<br />
  And stood there bodied in you, David, brother,<br />
  O dear young shepherd from your sheepfolds called&mdash;<br />
  Nay Jonathan myself it was there standing,<br />
  Or barren branches of myself in flower,<br />
  My jailored thought flooded with light of song.<br />
  And in that moment nothing was between<br />
  Your soul and mine, and knowing you, I loved,<br />
  Since love is understanding, and must come<br />
  When mind looks on the presence of very mind.<br />
  I loved you, David, and I love, and ever&mdash;<br />
  Because my mind, even in one day's passing,<br />
  Has learnt you as no years could better learn&mdash;<br />
  My love is fixed upon you. And, moreover,<br />
  Since from this hour I must for ever know<br />
  Some element of me lodged sole in you,<br />
  Some certainty in you alone to be<br />
  Among my weeds the patient husbandman,<br />
  I must in your love prosper or not at all.<br />
  Now therefore, David, let a covenant be<br />
  Between us from this day, for the heart knows."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  David and Jonathan under the long torches<br />
  Were silent then. And David's eyes were fixed<br />
  Long upon Jonathan, as eyes may sometimes look<br />
  On eyes, and see no face, looking beyond<br />
  Into unimaged life, into the brain<br />
  Moving behind the circumstance of flesh,<br />
  Eyes that to-morrow passing might hardly know<br />
  The mere face that to-night they gaze upon.<br />
  And Jonathan having spoken, waited there<br />
  While David searched him slowly with still eyes.<br />
  Then David rose, and drew the tent-fold back,<br />
  And looked upon the stars of Palestine<br />
  Long, and a mallow moon; and Jonathan waited.<br />
  Then David came again, and spoke, "I too,<br />
  Standing this morning in your father's tent,<br />
  Knew that a life unwonted was near me there.<br />
  And now you have spoken, and the love you say,<br />
  I know, and as your will is so is mine.<br />
  Something I am for you that none can be.<br />
  Let it be so, but all is not then said.<br />
  This morning when I smote the Philistine,<br />
  I was God's purpose, that I must believe.<br />
  But purpose only is not all of God,<br />
  Hearing you now, I know it is not all.<br />
  When first I saw you I did not know it then&mdash;<br />
  Only, facing the Philistine, something new<br />
  A moment marked me, and unnoted went,<br />
  No touch of it upon my will. But now<br />
  I have heard you speak, and what it was I know.<br />
  You loved me, Jonathan, seeing, as I stood,<br />
  That shadowy self of you of which you tell me<br />
  Suddenly living fearless in the sun.<br />
  That is your reaping of my field, and I<br />
  Glory to give it you. But were that all,<br />
  Proud to be loved, I should not love again.<br />
  But now I know for me is too a reaping.<br />
  Your shadow to my living purpose leaps,<br />
  And that is wonderful. But as you spoke<br />
  Some David hidden from the man that slew<br />
  Goliath listened also, and is now<br />
  With us for ever. And he that wrought this life<br />
  Is you, Jonathan of doubts and speculation,<br />
  The man who sits there plainly now, the mere<br />
  Jonathan when the shadow is forgotten.<br />
  Now do I know my purpose magnified,<br />
  Sure as of old, but learning in its flight,<br />
  Of pity and the sad heart of man from you,<br />
  And how the jealous and unmerciful,<br />
  Being stricken down, are but poor sorrows too.<br />
  So, Jonathan my brother, as you take,<br />
  So do you give, and in us now shall be<br />
  The perfect whole of purpose and compassion,<br />
  And resolution without pride of heart.<br />
  Now therefore will I make the covenant,<br />
  Knowing that never more can you or I<br />
  Without this love be better than a tale<br />
  Of corrupting seed and fallow-lands unsown."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Now Jonathan rose and put the torches out,<br />
  And a grey beam of dawn was on those two.<br />
  And Jonathan took his outer garment off,<br />
  Which was the king's son's, and robed David there,<br />
  And he took the sword that Saul had given him,<br />
  Belted in gold and cased in figured steel,<br />
  And it hung on David's loins. And Jonathan said,<br />
  "Who fails in this, that is the last betrayal,<br />
  The quenching of the holy spirit of God."<br />
  And David said, "So be it." And they embraced,<br />
  And kissed. And David went into the dawn.<br />
  And Jonathan watched until the day was full.<br />

  THE MAID OF NAAMAN'S WIFE<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  That was the proud woman, Naaman's wife.<br />
  Basking at noon under the Syrian fans,<br />
  While Naaman, the leprous mighty captain,<br />
  Proud glowing flesh now silver-skinned and tainted,<br />
  Walked in contagion here and there, apart.<br />
  His wife, the unblemished Naaman in her mind,<br />
  The man who, coming with the spoils and shouts,<br />
  Had made a hundred triumphs hers, when all<br />
  The Syrian women courted her for that,<br />
  Now saw in the pestilent limbs shame and reproach,<br />
  Some treachery that made her, who was mate<br />
  Of Syria's pride, bondwoman of a leper.<br />
  She must nurse her blame, since he was Naaman still,<br />
  With an old honour paid by stedfastness,<br />
  The mark of Syria's compassion. Black<br />
  Thoughts were her only payment for betrayal,<br />
  But in secret she could play them without pity,&mdash;<br />
  Let the fans beat, they could not beguile her from that.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And Naaman had loved her, but not now,<br />
  Knowing the uses that his love had been,<br />
  How given for her to squander it in pride.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Syria out of Israel had brought<br />
  Captives, and among them one, a maid,<br />
  A little maid, just troubled with the touch<br />
  Of womanhood upon her body and thought,<br />
  And she served Naaman's wife, a lonely girl,<br />
  To answer bidding, and covet little tones<br />
  Of kindness that she heard go to and fro,<br />
  But not for her. She trembled as she stood<br />
  At the proud woman's couch, because a fault<br />
  In orders done meant scolding and even rods.<br />
  And she had but two joys. One, to remember<br />
  A Galilean town, and the blue waters<br />
  That washed the pebbles that she knew so well,<br />
  Yellow in sunlight, or frozen in the moon,<br />
  A little curve of beach, where she would walk<br />
  At any hour with an old silver man.<br />
  Her father's father, her sole companion,<br />
  Who told her tales of Moses and the prophets<br />
  That lived in the old days. And of that time<br />
  She had but now poor treasuries of the mind,<br />
  Little seclusions when, the day's work done,<br />
  She made thought into prayer before she slept;<br />
  These, and a faded gown that she had brought<br />
  Into captivity, patterned with sprigs of thyme,<br />
  And blades of wheat, and little curling shells,<br />
  And signs of heaven figured out in stars,<br />
  Made by a weaver that her grandsire knew,<br />
  A gift on some thanksgiving. She might not wear it,<br />
  Being suited as became a slave, but often<br />
  At night she would spread it in her loneliness,<br />
  And think how finely she too might be drest,<br />
  As finely as any proud woman of them all,<br />
  If the God of Israel had not visited her<br />
  Surely for sin, though she could not remember.<br />
  Thus one joy was. And then the Lord Naaman,<br />
  This wonder soiled, this pitiful great captain<br />
  Forbidden all that he had so proudly been&mdash;<br />
  To worship him, that was her other joy.<br />
  When the dusk came, and the city fell to silence,<br />
  And out of his poor banishment he would walk,<br />
  She followed him, knowing the very hour,<br />
  And all her heart was flooded through with pity,<br />
  Because she knew the leprosy left still<br />
  A Naaman untainted and lovely.<br />
  Then in her mind was the proud woman a loathing,<br />
  Who dared to waste a marvel such as this,<br />
  The right in the world's knowledge so to love.<br />
  O pitiful evil blasting so great a flesh,<br />
  Walling a spirit so governing itself<br />
  In spite of desolation. A maid's thought thus<br />
  Knew how the frames of mastery can suffer.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Sometimes at night when not even lepers walked,<br />
  Solitary in the Syrian meadows she<br />
  Would wander in the old perplexity<br />
  That the moon makes of love. Never, she knew,<br />
  Could any adoration that she brought<br />
  Touch even the Lord Naaman's banishment,<br />
  The Naaman fallen from the time when even<br />
  Great ladies dare not speak the thing they felt.<br />
  She was nothing, or the world could never know<br />
  If she was more than nothing; a maid to bind<br />
  Tresses for beauty that was not her own.<br />
  And yet she knew that she had beauty too,<br />
  A little hermit beauty that might spend<br />
  Royally if it dare and a man would speak,&mdash;<br />
  Royally, Naaman, but he could not hear.<br />
  But still for all the silence of her lips,<br />
  And heart with promise nothing known, she loved&mdash;<br />
  Loved the sad leper walking in the dusk,<br />
  Loved the great lord, loved even his leprosy,<br />
  Since by it he came a little down to her,<br />
  Loved him, and knew that her love was the sum<br />
  Of all that loving, and must be. But even so,<br />
  She knew her love an honester thing than any<br />
  That the proud woman had. O moon, she thought,<br />
  Could you not make me truly tell this love,<br />
  This love pulsing along my blood and brain,<br />
  As midnight surges going through the sky?<br />
  And long she pondered how she best might serve.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then one day when the fans moved, and she stood<br />
  Ministering with her perfumes at the couch,<br />
  Her mistress, with eyes that meant the thought was nothing,<br />
  Said, "Is it not grievous that my lord goes thus?"<br />
  And the maid felt the colour at her throat<br />
  Flow round her neck and flood up to her temples,<br />
  But knowing, feared not, or put her fear aside,<br />
  And said "Would God my lord were in Samaria,<br />
  To seek Elisha there, a prophet, lady,<br />
  Whom God hath taught to cure whom he will cure."<br />
  She spoke, and the bright bowl trembled in her hands,<br />
  And fear because of her words made the tongue dry<br />
  As the woman looked with still cold eyes upon her.<br />
  But the word passed from lip to lip, and the king<br />
  Heard it, and sent for Naaman and said,<br />
  "A girl among the slaves that you brought in<br />
  From Israel has spoken a strange thing,<br />
  Of one Elisha, a prophet whom they obey,<br />
  Saying that he could bid the blemish off<br />
  That is cheating Syria of her proudest man.<br />
  Now therefore journey to him, and I will send<br />
  Word to Israel's king, that he shall bless<br />
  Favours from us in whom his fortune lies,<br />
  Bidding him call this prophet to your cause.<br />
  Go, and the love of Syria go with you."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then Naaman with his servants went at dawn,<br />
  And Naaman's wife saw how again might come<br />
  Her mastery among the women of Syria.<br />
  Yet was the little maid her hatred now,<br />
  Lest of her word should come this resurrection.<br />
  And Naaman went, and Israel's king was glad,<br />
  Because of Syria's favour, and sent down<br />
  The hill to where Elisha lived among<br />
  Farmers of flax and goatherds and a few<br />
  Unhappy men who brought their sorrow to God,<br />
  Asking his mercy on the Syrian lord.<br />
  And Naaman stood before the prophet of Israel,<br />
  And told his grief. And Elisha looked upon him,<br />
  Measured his faith, and bade him bathe his body<br />
  Seven times in the river of Jordan, and be<br />
  Whole. And Naaman questioned, and was wrath,<br />
  As was not any river of Damascus<br />
  Purer than Jordan, and in more virtue flowing?<br />
  But, little, his servants said, was this to do,<br />
  And, as persuasion led him, he went down<br />
  And seven times let Jordan cover him,<br />
  And came with a clean body as of old,<br />
  A strong man with the tides of blood before him,<br />
  With equal limbs for all the spirit could dare,<br />
  And into Syria he sang upon his riding.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And tidings came to the Syrian king of this,<br />
  Heralding a Naaman mightier than ever,<br />
  With clean flesh and a wisdom all matured,<br />
  And all the city rang upon his coming,<br />
  The king and his estate, people and priests,<br />
  And soldiers glad of their old captain again.<br />
  And matrons with their girls, and the rich merchants,<br />
  All shouted Naaman, Naaman, through the streets.<br />
  And Naaman's wife stood at the king's right hand,<br />
  Her slave-borne canopy coloured and spangled,<br />
  While the great fans beat upon her pride again,<br />
  And Naaman in plumes and plate and mail<br />
  Again was master of the Syrian hosts.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Afar, beyond the barriers of the streets,<br />
  Pressing among the crowd for a moment's seeing,<br />
  The Israelitish maid, between her duties,<br />
  Watched with a proud flush beating down her limbs.<br />
  And shyly she had on a faded gown,<br />
  Patterned with sprigs of thyme and blades of wheat,<br />
  And paling stars and little curling shells.<br />
  And as the shouting rose, she watched in silence,<br />
  With trembling lips, and Naaman passed by her,<br />
  And her hands moved towards him, and fell down,<br />
  Then stole upon her bosom, as they would ease<br />
  The aching beauty of her loneliness.<br />
  And there unnoted as he passed she stood,<br />
  With not a thought from all that world upon her.<br />
  Only, when service came again, she saw<br />
  A glowing hatred in the proud woman's eyes.<br />
  And in the night she thought of it, and wept,<br />
  But not for any hatred were her tears.<br />

  LAKE WINTER<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Full summer dusk was round him as he stood<br />
  On the hill-top, over the calling sheep<br />
  Drifting along the pastured downs. The moon<br />
  Far off was rising from the Sussex sea.<br />
  Above him, building up into the sky,<br />
  Black, and with pointing sails now skeletoned,<br />
  A windmill gathered strays of evening wind<br />
  Whispering through the splitting timbers. Still<br />
  The setting sun washed with a fuller gold<br />
  The golden sheaves patterned upon a cone<br />
  Of downland by him farther from the sea.<br />
  So still, he seemed a thing woven of earth,<br />
  A life rooted and fixed as were the oaks<br />
  Locked in the soil, their bases webbed with fleece<br />
  Of sheltering ewes, he watched across the valley,<br />
  And the hour passed, and the black mill grew and grew,<br />
  And then a light came in a far window<br />
  Of a grey farm cresting the hill beyond,<br />
  And sudden tides beat on him as he saw<br />
  A white dress moving in the distant pines.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Lake Winter, a five hundred acre man,<br />
  Was English, bred far back, a part of England,<br />
  With South and North and Midland in his blood.<br />
  And somewhere Devon, somewhere Suffolk too.<br />
  He had been born of love. They had been lovers,<br />
  Who made him, and no more, but they were lovers.<br />
  She of a proud house, proud to make it prouder<br />
  With wit and beauty, and a young brain glowing,<br />
  And a swift body fearless and pitiful;<br />
  And he a Cotswold yeoman, thrift and power,<br />
  And mastery of earth and herds and flocks,<br />
  And knowledge of all seasons and their fruits,<br />
  And a heart of meditation, all his birthright;<br />
  Ten generations deep from Gloucester stone.<br />
  And those two met, and loved, and of their love<br />
  Came a new purity of blood and limb,<br />
  As of a purpose slowly moulding them.<br />
  And long they waited, and then one summer noon,<br />
  He, coming northward from his Cotswold home,<br />
  Found her by Rydal as she had bidden him,<br />
  And proudly stride to stride they took the road,<br />
  Sure youth by youth, and to Helvellyn's foot<br />
  They came, and climbed up to the brighter air,<br />
  And into the wind's ardour still went on,<br />
  Until upon the mountain top they stood,<br />
  And lake by lake was fading in the dusk.<br />
  Out of the plains they saw the moon move up<br />
  And over them the deeper blue came on,<br />
  The faint stars glowing into mastery.<br />
  And in that splendour of a summer hill,<br />
  Amid the mellow-breathing night, where yet<br />
  The poppies of the valley could not come,<br />
  There was conceived a boy....<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   And sorrow came<br />
  Upon their love. Before the moon again<br />
  Was full upon Helvellyn, the Cotswold lover<br />
  With a great elm was blasted in a storm,<br />
  And lay, a burnt thing, in a Cotswold grave.<br />
  And she went out, took her inheritance,<br />
  And lived apart, and the man-child was born.<br />
  She called him Lake, for those fading lakes of dusk,<br />
  And gave him her own name. And twenty years<br />
  She tended him, and died; and from her substance<br />
  Lake Winter now for fifteen years had kept<br />
  His Sussex acres in fertility.<br />
  Such was the man, so born, so passionately made,<br />
  So knit of English earth and generations,<br />
  Who now upon the summer evening watched&mdash;<br />
  His manhood full upon his middle years&mdash;<br />
  A white dress moving in the distant pines.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  .....<br />

<p class="poem">
  Down to the valley from their hills they came,<br />
  Lake Winter and the woman that he loved.<br />
  He waited by a long brown garden wall,<br />
  Mottled with moss and lichen, where in the dusk<br />
  Like a great moth a late flycatcher wove,<br />
  And watched her coming down a rutted path,<br />
  Towards him. And the flowing of her body,<br />
  Sure step through fugitive cadences of limb,<br />
  Up to the little golden arch of hair,<br />
  Was lovely as a known yet wanted tale.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Zell Dane, the wife of Martin Dane, who held<br />
  Tollington Manor farm, was ten years wed.<br />
  Dane was an honest man by groom and horse,<br />
  Paid pew-rent and his losing wagers, thought<br />
  The British Empire lived at Westminster,<br />
  Stood by the State and rights of property,<br />
  Drank well, and knew the barmaids of a county.<br />
  He married Zell, and neither could have said<br />

<p class="poem">
  Lake Winter came and went at Tollington,<br />
  As other neighbours, a little in Dane's mind<br />
  Suspect for certain rumours of his birth,<br />
  But known for a straight rider and plain speaker,<br />
  Who meant his words and had words for his meaning.<br />
  And Lake and Zell, between the jests at table,<br />
  Where they could match the best wits of the room,<br />
  Would talk of things that Dane and the rest counted<br />
  As pointing ways not good for level minds.<br />
  Why pose about Beethoven, and Debussy,<br />
  Or these French fellows Degas and Picasso,<br />
  When there were Marcus Stone, and A Long, Long Trail,<br />
  And "A Little Grey Home in the West," that common folk<br />
  Could understand? And, however the truth might be,<br />
  It wasn't decent openly to say<br />
  That William Wordsworth was a better poet&mdash;<br />
  Though more or less in a poet was no matter&mdash;<br />
  Because it seemed that once in his flaming youth<br />
  He had loved gloriously in France....<br />

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Dane heard and saw,<br />
  And was a little troubled that clear heads<br />
  Should cloud and squander thus, a little scornful.<br />
  Still if it gave them pleasure, and it but meant<br />
  Mind with mind idling together so,<br />
  Winter could come and go for all he cared,<br />
  He wouldn't grudge ... and then the doubt began,<br />
  A thought that somewhere under all this play<br />
  And nimbleness was crouching the true thing,<br />
  Lust, plain lust. There was between man and woman,<br />
  So Dane had learnt, two several conditions,<br />
  A compact to keep smooth the day's affairs,<br />
  That, and plain lust. This mind play was a sham....<br />
  Winter and Zell were lusting, that was all...<br />
  Then let them... damn it, let the matter be...<br />
  Time would show all, and there were crops and hounds.<br />

  LAKE. How shall they stand for wisdom, who forbid<br />

  If I could grudge love coming anywhere,<br />
  Falling even on whom I loved in all,<br />
  I think the body at least should have no share<br />
  Of jealousy from me, which should be spent<br />
  Rather on minds meeting above my own,<br />
  Myself an exile from their understanding.<br />
  Beloved, in the mating of our minds<br />
  I am all peace to walk thus in your presence,<br />
  And in that peace your body of my desire,<br />
  And all my earth, as passionate as any,<br />
  Seem snares to tempt us to the loss of all,<br />
  Since by them the world threatens this our peace,<br />
  Which else we may so gather, undenied.<br />

  I know you, Lake, for a man worthy honour,<br />

  And then I know that over you as well<br />
  The dear, forlorn, resistless pain is full.<br />
  We may persuade, virtuously persuade,<br />
  That this is but an accident of love,<br />
  Not of love's very being, a thing to bind<br />
  In brave captivity at the world's bidding,<br />
  But I know, as you know it, that persuasion<br />
  So made is outcast in the house of truth.<br />
  I love you, and the thing I love is made<br />
  All wonderful of flesh and spirit both,<br />
  Body and mind inseparably one,<br />
  And I must spend my love on all or nothing.<br />
  Should I but love those limbs so rightly planned<br />
  By ancestry so wise of English earth,<br />
  It were a simple harlotry in me.<br />
  But, Lake, to love the life and not the house,<br />
  The living house so admirably built<br />
  Of tissue flawless as the material stars,<br />
  Wherein the life I love is manifest,<br />
  Were harlotry no less I know than that.<br />
  You, the dear Lake of my idolatry,<br />
  For I am something near it, as you are,<br />
  Are one life, whereto pilgrim thought conspires<br />
  With all the cunning moulding of the flesh,<br />
  And of my brain and body is my love,<br />
  Dream to your dream, desire to your desire.<br />
  If you should die, my memory of you<br />
  Would be no tale of the mere mind conceiving,<br />
  Of contemplation thriving thus or thus,<br />
  In trance of spaces where not even wings nor breath<br />
  Recall the moving of substantial things.<br />
  Rather in me for ever should be glowing<br />
  The imaging mind mated in equal limbs,<br />
  Thought visible in lines of the athlete,<br />
  Wisdom persuading in the lover's clasp.<br />
  And how should thought know thought until the whole<br />
  Of body's beauty is by body learnt?<br />
  Until the trial of that most dear seclusion<br />
  Is past, and all the dangers of mere lust<br />
  Disproved, when in possession is no stale<br />
  Regret and disillusion, how should be known<br />
  That the still hours of thought with thought are stable<br />
  Against the wearing of dissolving time?<br />
  Dear, we must love by all the tokens of love,<br />
  Before the presence of love beyond dispute<br />
  Is between us and for ever fixed.<br />

  Lake heard, and knew that answer could be none,<br />
  Then by the sheep-tracks on the silver downs<br />
  Silent they walked, and midnight came apace,<br />
  And by the bases of the mill they went,<br />
  Close moving, arm by arm, and down again<br />
  Towards the valley, where again they stood,<br />
  And let their lives beat out upon the night.<br />
  And as they waited on farewell, a form<br />
  Came up before them, and Martin Dane stood there,<br />
  And "by your leave," he murmured, and went on.<br />
  Then Zell, "To-morrow, when the moon is full,<br />
  Meet me beside the mill mound. Martin goes<br />
  To Farnham for the otter hunting." Lake<br />
  Took her and kissed, and with no word they parted<br />
  Where the light still looked from the hillside farm<br />
  Over the valley to his home. And he<br />
  As dreaming passed again by the mill to sleep.<br />

  Firmer the mould, surer the flight of boughs,<br />

  All day he drew and pegged the rickyard straw,<br />
  And piled the barn from floor to the swallows' beam,<br />
  Brown throated and brown armed, the golden rose<br />
  Of summer wind glowing upon his face,<br />
  And all the phrasing of his body good.<br />
  And twilight fell on the full harvest home,<br />
  And the barn doors were closed, and painted wagons<br />
  Stood empty by the ricks, with sunken wheels<br />
  Smeared with the fallen husks, and voice was none,<br />
  And silence with the moon was over all.<br />

  Lake through the eve walked his familiar paths,<br />
  Counting the labour of his years; the shed<br />
  Where morn and night the cattle came to stall,<br />
  Empty and still now but for the timbering rats;<br />
  The low smooth paven dairy, where the moon<br />
  Now sent a shaft on one full yellow bowl;<br />
  The barn so happily at teeming time again,<br />
  The rickyard stacked with hurdles by the fence,<br />
  The long loft over plough and wagon teams.<br />
  Among the heavy apple trees he passed,<br />
  By ledgy sheep track, over the new stubble,<br />
  Across the valley, and in the shadow kept<br />
  Of Martin Dane's home hop-yard, and again<br />
  Back to his own hillside. And in the south,<br />

  Zell by the mill was standing when he came,<br />
  Now darkly gowned so that she seemed a shadow,<br />
  Black by the black mill, save for the white face,<br />
  And gold hair and white hands that caught the moonlight.<br />
  Together the wide wooden steps they climbed,<br />
  By broken treads and splitting rail, and he<br />
  Lifted the rusted latch, and there within<br />
  Were folded sacks perished along the seam,<br />
  Forgotten with the dust, and the bare walls,<br />
  Now weather-broken. Above them a dim light<br />
  Showed them a laddered way still up. They came<br />
  Into the high roof chamber, and a rent<br />
  In the top timbers let the moonlight in,<br />
  Half moulding to their vision spars and beams,<br />
  The mill's old ghostly life, and sail-cloth piled<br />
  From the use of generations. A window space<br />
  Just from their towery refuge let them look<br />
  Over familiar earth now tranced. And Lake<br />
  Saw yet again his roofs and acres loved,<br />
  Tenderly, as though interpreters<br />
  Of his long care and their good yielding hours<br />
  Freshly upon his senses ministered; Zell<br />
  Across the valley saw a lone slumbering light,<br />
  While from the south the mounting darkness crept,<br />

  Filling its frame with a low pulsing breath.<br />

  And over love the heavenly figures went<br />
  In their unchanging change. No longer now<br />

  And in those hours of peace that only comes<br />
  With passion mated and of passion born,<br />
  Lake knew within him stirring that far beauty<br />
  Of an old starry still Helvellyn night.<br />
  And Zell made all the wisdom of her words<br />
  Wisdom of life, so simple and unclouded,<br />
  Leaving no fume of trouble in the dark,<br />
  Ending for ever the brain's captivity.<br />

  They slept. And still the south wind gathered up,<br />
  Gust upon gust to a full swelling tide,<br />
  And the great sail-timbers groaned, and blackness fell<br />
  Over the mill that trembled as in pain<br />
  Of age now nearly with all quarrels done.<br />
  Along the ridges of the downs it swept,<br />
  Beating the boughs of ash and elm, a flood<br />
  Of storm exulting in deliverance.<br />
  And fury up and down the valleys played<br />
  And rose and spilt and sank upon the hills,<br />
  And to and fro the thunder bayed, till sudden<br />
  The world about the sleeping lovers shook<br />
  With sounding doom. And Zell, waking, cried out,<br />
  And he beside her stood, and folded her<br />
  A moment as from fear, and kissed her, and they turned<br />
  To go, when from the bases of the mill<br />
  A shrieking as of life being crushed and torn<br />
  Clanged out upon the beating elements,<br />
  And the hurt timbers, whipped and wrencht, sent up<br />
  A last fierce wail, and for a moment swayed,<br />
  Then gave the life up of a hundred years,<br />

  Sleepers along the hill-top in the night<br />
  Stirred as a ruin above the thunder broke,<br />

  And on the sea the little ships went on<br />
  With sails just filled with a small virgin wind.<br />
  And slowly one by one the village came<br />
  To see the old mill that their sires had known,<br />
  And sires beyond them, blasted in a world<br />
  Where peace was lord as in immortal mood.<br />
  They stood and silence kept them until one<br />
  Saw suddenly upon the dawn breeze blown,<br />
  Out from a mound of split and twisted timber<br />
  A strand of golden hair. And strong arms worked<br />
  Until upon the grass unheeding lay<br />
  Those two dear bodies locked in a love that now<br />
  Was beyond malice and denial and fear.<br />

  And on the night a whispered cadence fell&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Again in the world, a story has been made,<br />
  These looked upon beauty unafraid,<br />

<p class="poem">
  Pity them not; they would scorn that as your hate,<br />

<p class="poem">
  Kindled for ever because of them shall be<br />

  BURNING BUSH<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  From babyhood I have known the beauty of earth&mdash;<br />
  I learnt it, I think, in the strange months before birth,<br />
  I learnt it passing and passing by each moon<br />
  From the harvest month into my natal June.<br />
  My mother, the dear, the lovely I hardly knew,<br />
  Bearing me must have walked and wandered through<br />
  Stubble of silver or gold, as moon or sun<br />
  Lit earth in the days when my body was begun.<br />
  And then October with leaves splendid and blown<br />
  She watched with my little body a little grown,<br />
  And winter fell, and into our being passed<br />
  Firm frost and icy rivers and the blast<br />
  Of winds that on the iron clods of plough<br />
  Beat with an unseen charging. Then the bough<br />
  Of spring came green, and her glad body stirred<br />
  With a son's wombed leaping, and she heard<br />
  Songs of the air and woods and waterways,<br />
  And with them singing the coming of my days.<br />
  And nesting time drew on to summer flowers,<br />
  And me unborn she taught through patient hours.<br />
  Then on that first June day, with spices blown<br />
  Of roses over clover crops unmown,<br />
  And grey wind-lifted leaves and blossom of bean,<br />
  She gave her dear white beauty to the keen<br />
  Anguish of women, and brought my body to birth<br />
  Already skilled in the sculptures of the earth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then in the days when her breasts nourished me,<br />
  Daily she walked, that happy girl, to see<br />
  How summer prospered to bring the harvest on,<br />
  And how the gardens and how the orchards shone<br />
  With scarlet and blue and yellow flowers and fruit,<br />
  And hear with equal love the lonely flute<br />
  Of legendary satyrs in the wood,<br />
  Or the still voice of Christ in bachelorhood.<br />
  And she would come I know to me her son<br />
  With lovely secret gossip of journeys done<br />
  In fields where some day my own feet should go.<br />
  It was not gossip in words that I could not know,<br />
  Mere ease and pleasure for her mother wit,<br />
  But such as I could feel the joy of it<br />
  Beating about my baby blood and sense,<br />
  Maternal tending of intelligence<br />
  In the unwhispered rites of bosom and lip,<br />
  Divinings worded in bodily fellowship.<br />
  And every shape and colour and scent she knew,<br />
  Were intimations winding, folding, through<br />
  My infancies of flesh and thought, each one<br />
  To find its unblemished record and copy done<br />
  In little moods drawn from the suckling-breast...<br />
  That now, in manhood, when I find the nest<br />
  Of the chaffinch moulded in the elder tree,<br />
  And looking on that lichen cup can see<br />
  The images of eternity and space<br />
  Lavished upon a small bird's dwelling-place:<br />
  Or when from some blue passage of the sky<br />
  I know that also colour can prophesy:<br />
  Or, ghosted on the brushing tides of wheat,<br />
  The gossip of a Galilean street,<br />
  So many Sabbaths gone, I hear again,<br />
  And his hands plucking that immortal grain:<br />
  Or when by spectral ancestries I pass<br />
  Again to Eden, as the orchard grass<br />
  Gives out the scent of mellow apples blown<br />
  From windy boughs&mdash;all these, I know, were known<br />
  By that dear mother when the boy to come<br />
  Was the zeal and gospel of her martyrdom.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Then came the time when I could walk with her,<br />
  We pilgrims of the fields, with everywhere<br />
  Strange leaves, and spreading of earth, and hedgerow themes,<br />
  And mossy walls, and bubbling of the streams,<br />
  And the way of clouds, and the full moon to wane,<br />
  The bird-song in the lilacs after rain,<br />
  And month by month the coming of the flowers,<br />
  for me to learn in speech, as had been ours<br />
  Knowledge unspoken while she fashioned me...<br />
  And then she died; and I went on to be<br />
  Through lonely boyhood her disciple still,<br />
  A wanderer by many a Berkshire hill,<br />
  By water-meadows of the Oxford plain,<br />
  By the thick oaks of Avon, with the strain<br />
  Of an old yeoman wisdom dreaming on<br />
  New beauty ever following beauty gone,<br />
  Until I knew my earth and her raiment fair<br />
  In every difference of the seasons' wear,<br />
  Long years her scholar, with learning of her ways<br />
  To slip unleasht all singing into praise<br />
  Should learning yet by some enchantment be<br />
  Bidden to passion's better husbandry.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And the enchanted bidding fell. And you,<br />
  O Love, it was that spelt the earth anew.<br />

<p class="poem">
  O Love, you silent wayfarer,<br />
  How many years all unaware<br />
  By blackthorn hedge, and spinney green<br />

  Even a whisper in the shade.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O Love, on many an evening hill<br />
  I watched the day go down, the still<br />
  Dark woods, the far great rivers wind,<br />
  Thin threads of light. And I was blind,<br />
  Or seeing knew not, for you were<br />
  Beside me still, yet hidden there.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O Love, as year by year went on,<br />
  And budding primroses were gone,<br />
  And berries fell, and still the bright<br />
  Crocuses came in the night,<br />
  You left me to my task alone,<br />
  O Love, so near me and unknown.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O Love, though she who bore me set<br />
  Earth's love for ever on me, yet<br />
  Some word withheld still troubled me,<br />
  Some presence that I could not see,<br />
  Till you, dear alien, should come,<br />
  And doctrine be no longer dumb.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O Love, one April night I heard<br />
  The doctrine's everlasting word,<br />
  And you beneath that starry sky,<br />
  Unknown, were with me suddenly,<br />
  Yet there was no new meeting then,<br />
  But some old marriage come again.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O Love, and now is earth my friend,<br />
  Telling me all, until the end<br />
  When I shall in the earth be laid<br />

  Of my blind following from birth.<br />

  O Love, you happy wayfarer,<br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
